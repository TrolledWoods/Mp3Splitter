# Soundtrack Splitter
The purpose of this software is to allow
soundfiles containing entire soundtracks
to be split into a folder of individual tracks
simply by giving the typical `TimeStamp - Song Name`
formatting.

This is of course specifically designed for
soundtracks downloaded via youtube. I take no
responsibility for any illegal actions done
by this software. _You should always make sure
that you own the soundtrack or the soundtrack
is free to download._

## Formatting
As stated above, the software requires a list 
of timestamps for each song, like this;

```
00:00 SongA
02:53 SongB
05:12 SongC
```

If you have any suggestions for more types
of formatting, feel free to put up an issue for
it.
